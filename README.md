## Topic Modeling for Citation statements

This repo goes over several methods for topic modeling for citation statements.
Including:
- LDA (LDA.ipynb)
- Contextual Topic Models (CTM.ipynb)
- Zeroshot Topic Models (ZTM.ipynb)
- Multi-document and Query Gen for Better Topic Representations (MDS.ipynb)

This repo uses a set of more than 700 citations to (10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5) to identify groups of citations and provide human readable representations.
Other than LDA, a GPU should be used for the other notebooks.
