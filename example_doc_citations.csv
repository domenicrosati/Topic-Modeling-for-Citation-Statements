Previous assessments of the subject coverage of Scopus and WOS CC used Scopus’ ASJC at the five-category level (Visser et al, <cite data-doi=""10.1162/qss_a_00112""> 2021 </cite> ), Google Scholar categories at the 252 and eight-category levels (Martín-Martín et al, <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-018-2820-9""> 2018a </cite> , <cite data-doi=""10.1016/j.joi.2018.09.002""> 2018b </cite> , <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-020-03690-4""> 2021 </cite> ), the National Science Foundation classification at the four-category level (Mongeon &amp; Paul-Hus, <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5""> 2016 </cite> ), WOS classification at the five-category level (Singh et al, <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-021-03948-5""> 2021 </cite> ) or not closer specified classifications at the four-category level ( Aksnes &amp; Sivertsen, <cite data-doi=""10.2478/jdis-2019-0001""> 2019 </cite> ) and self-specified classifications at the five-category level (Harzing &amp; Alakangas, <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-015-1798-9""> 2016 </cite> ). As it is difficult to identify the best classification system, a multitude of different approaches might encourage better research classifications by comparing and learning (Wang &amp; Waltman, <cite data-doi=""10.1016/j.joi.2016.02.003""> 2016 </cite> )."
2814976168,"10.1007/s11192-022-04289-7","Fourth, an important question is how subject coverage is determined in terms of multi- or single-attribution. Most of the studies found comparing the subject coverage of Scopus and WOS CC assume one record is unequivocally attributable to a single subject: For example, Mongeon and Paul-Hus ( <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5""> 2016 </cite> ) assume journals are categorizable into one of four disciplines, and Martín-Martín et al ( <cite data-doi=""10.1007/s11192-020-03690-4""> 2021 </cite> ) assume cited documents share the same single subject the seed document was classified against under the Google Scholar categories.
